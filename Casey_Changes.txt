1. API Key set in multiple configs, only needs to be set in env script. 
2. Consolidated the various Applitools config files since they're already dynamic from parameters. Removed the various config settings in RunSiteMap, but still allowing different configs to be passed in. 
3. Included "deleteOn" functionality for baseline updates. This encourages updates and compares to be run in the same execution / batch. 
4. setSaveFailedTests now defaults to "false", as this is the bet practice for any non-baseline update behavior. 
5. Changed grouping numbers (sitmap url groups -> 2) and run commands (start) to expedite performance.
