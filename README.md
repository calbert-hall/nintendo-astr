## Instructions ##

1. Clone the Repo
2. Replace your API key in the Applitools config file. 
3. I was running in prod since I couldn't access UAT for some reason, so you'll need to replace the sitemap URLs with UAT versions. 
4. Go ahead and run `RunSiteMap.zsh`. Currently it's set to update English baselines, and then compare fr-ca and es-mx against these.
